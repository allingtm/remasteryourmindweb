# Construction Field Management App

## The Challenge

BuildCorp Construction had a familiar problem in the industry: their field teams were drowning in paperwork. Site managers spent hours each day:

- Filling out paper progress reports
- Taking photos and manually uploading them later
- Phoning the office to report issues
- Waiting for information about other trades

The result was delayed information, data entry errors, and frustrated teams both on-site and in the office.

## Our Approach

We spent time on active construction sites, shadowing site managers to understand their daily workflows. Key insights:

- Connectivity is unreliable on many sites
- Workers wear gloves and work in all weather
- Photos are essential but annotation is needed
- Speed matters - nobody wants long forms

## The Solution

We built a Flutter-based mobile app designed for construction environments:

### Daily Progress Reporting
- Quick-entry forms designed for gloved operation
- Photo capture with annotation tools
- Voice notes for detailed commentary
- Works completely offline, syncs when connected

### Issue Tracking
- Report problems with photo evidence
- Assign to contractors or trades
- Track resolution status
- Escalation notifications

### Site Dashboard
- Real-time progress across all trades
- Weather-aware scheduling
- Resource allocation visibility
- Document access (drawings, specs)

### Push Notifications
- Critical alerts via OneSignal
- Daily summary reports
- Task assignments and updates

## Technical Implementation

Built for reliability and offline-first operation:

- **Mobile App**: Flutter for iOS and Android from single codebase
- **Backend**: Supabase for real-time sync and authentication
- **Storage**: Firebase for photo and document storage
- **Notifications**: OneSignal for reliable push delivery
- **Offline**: SQLite local storage with sync queue

## Results

After rollout across all active sites:

- **3 hours saved daily** per site manager on paperwork
- **95% reduction** in data entry errors through direct digital capture
- **Real-time visibility** replaced end-of-day reports
- **200+ field users** actively using the app daily

## Impact

The app fundamentally changed how BuildCorp operates. Project managers now have real-time visibility into site progress without phone calls. Issues are identified and resolved faster. And site teams actually enjoy using the app - the highest compliment we can receive.

We continue to enhance the platform with features like materials tracking and integration with their ERP system.
