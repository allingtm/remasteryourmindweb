# NHS Trust Patient Portal

## The Challenge

The NHS Foundation Trust was facing a common but significant problem: patients had no digital way to manage their appointments. Everything went through the call centre, resulting in:

- Long wait times for patients trying to book or reschedule
- High administrative overhead for staff
- Significant number of missed appointments (Did Not Attends)
- No way for patients to access their medical records

## Our Approach

We worked closely with the Trust's clinical and IT teams to understand patient needs and NHS requirements. Key considerations included:

- NHS Digital compliance and security standards
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Integration with existing Patient Administration System (PAS)
- Mobile-first design for patients on the go

## The Solution

We delivered a comprehensive patient portal with:

### Appointment Management
- View upcoming and past appointments
- Book new appointments based on referrals
- Reschedule or cancel with automated notifications
- Appointment reminders via email and SMS

### Medical Records Access
- View test results when released by clinicians
- Access letters and correspondence
- Download records for personal use

### Secure Messaging
- Contact departments with queries
- Receive responses in-portal
- Audit trail of all communications

## Technical Implementation

Built on modern, maintainable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js and React for a responsive, accessible interface
- **Backend**: .NET Web API for secure NHS-compliant services
- **Database**: MS-SQL with encrypted patient data
- **Hosting**: Azure with NHS-approved security configuration
- **Integration**: HL7 FHIR for PAS connectivity

## Results

The portal launched on time and within budget. Within the first year:

- **40% reduction** in missed appointments through reminders and easy rescheduling
- **60% decrease** in call centre volume as patients self-served online
- **25,000+ patients** registered and actively using the portal
- **99.9% uptime** maintained throughout the year

## Ongoing Partnership

We continue to support and enhance the portal, with recent additions including:

- COVID-19 vaccination booking integration
- Virtual consultation links
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Additional language support

The Trust has since expanded our engagement to other digital transformation projects.
